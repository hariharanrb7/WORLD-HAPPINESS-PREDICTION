## Overview

The World Happiness Report is an annual publication that ranks countries based on their happiness levels. This project aims to:
- Explore key determinants of happiness across countries
- Predict a nation's happiness ranking based on socio-economic indicators
- Analyze the impact of societal and environmental factors on happiness levels
- Develop a user-friendly website for predicting happiness scores

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering and selection
- Implementation of various regression models
- Model comparison and evaluation
- Prediction of happiness scores for new data

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/world-happiness-analysis](https://github.com/hariharanrb7/WORLD-HAPPINESS-REPORT.git


## Data

The project uses data from the World Happiness Report, including metrics such as:
- Ladder score
- GDP per capita
- Social support
- Healthy life expectancy
- Freedom to make life choices
- Generosity
- Perceptions of corruption

Data source: [World Happiness Report Dataset]()

## Models

We implement and compare the following regression models:
- Simple Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Ridge Regressor
- Lasso Regressor

## Results

Our analysis found that the Random Forest Regressor outperformed other models in predicting happiness scores, achieving the highest RÂ² score on the test dataset.


## Future Work

- Develop a user-friendly website for happiness score prediction
- Incorporate more recent data and additional features
- Explore deep learning models for potentially improved predictions
- Conduct country-specific analyses to identify unique happiness factors
